# Computer-Vision-Projects

These are a list of personal projects that consists of the following projects:

1. Spacial Filters:

   Spatial filtering is a process by which we can alter properties of an optical image by selectively removing certain spatial frequencies that make up an object, for example, filtering video data received from satellite and space probes, or removal of raster from a television picture or scanned image.

2. SIFT:

   SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) is a powerful technique for image matching that can identify and match features in images that are invariant to scaling, rotation, and affine distortion. It is widely used in computer vision applications, including image matching, object recognition, and 3D reconstruction.
   
3. SIFT + SVM Classifier

   Support Vector Machines(SVM) is considered to be a classification approach but it can be employed in both types of classification and regression problems. It can easily handle multiple continuous and categorical variables. SVM constructs a hyperplane in multidimensional space to separate different classes.
